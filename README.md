# Number Guesser

This project is a simple number guessing game built in HTML and Jquery.  A user selects a range to guess within, and the program chooses a random numnber within that range.  For each guess, the user will receive feedback whether the guess was higher/lower, invalid or correct.  Once a correct choice is made, the range increases by 20 (+-10 on each end of the range).
